## Legacy Streamlit demo

https://ai-cv-advisory-board.streamlit.app/

An AI-powered multi-agent system designed to analyze and optimize CVs. It uses **CrewAI**, **Streamlit**, and **Google Gemini** (or OpenAI) to compare your CV against job descriptions and provide expert feedback from a "Board" of specialized agents.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

The application follows a scalable, service-oriented architecture designed for maintainability and growth:

```

### Core Design Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI code is decoupled from business logic.
- **Stateless Services**: Logic is encapsulated in reusable services.
- **Centralized State**: Application state is managed through a single `StateManager`.
- **Observability**: Built-in structured logging and custom error handling.

## Prerequisites

- [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- A Google AI API Key (Gemini) or OpenAI API Key

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/carlosan1708/ai-cv-advisor-board
cd ai-cv-advisor-board
```

### 2. Set Up the Python Environment

#### On macOS/Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### On Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### Install Dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Development Setup (Optional):
If you plan to contribute, install development tools and pre-commit hooks:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pre-commit install
```

To run pre-commit checks manually on all files:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### 3. Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (or other keys as needed).

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8501`.
